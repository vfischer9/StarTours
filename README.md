This application was built using React, node, and npm.

Npm version 8.5.3.
Node version 16.14.0.

To run this application, the user should make sure they are in the second "star-tours" directory. Once in this directory, type "npm start" into your terminal.

# Steps taken to build Star Tours:
1. Created public repo at https://github.com/vfischer9/StarTours.
2. Created an empty React application.
3. Fetched SWAPI (The Star Wars API) data.
4. Displayed relevant SWAPI data to the user.
5. Utilized React Hooks to handle state change of user's chosen API values.
6. Installed React Calendar with "npm i react-calendar" to allow user's to choose trip start and end dates.
7. Allow user's to input data such as name, start/end dates, and trip type (one-way or round).
8. Allow user's to click on desired SWAPI data.
9. Displayed a trip summary at the bottom of the page.
10. Added logic to check if start-date is after end-date.
11. Added logic to check if the user's selected species resides in the desired destination planet. If not, the user cannot choose that planet. 
12. Imported images of each planet and hardcoded the image to display when the selected planet state is equal to the planet name string.


<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
